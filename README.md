### Deployment

If you want to host this on your own domain, fork/clone the repo and run `npm install` at the root. In `vite.config.json` change the `base` attribute to whatever directory you will be hosting on. Run `npm run dev` to make sure it compiles correctly, and then committing to your repo. You will need to set GH Pages to deploy via Actions, and allow Actions permissions to read and write.
